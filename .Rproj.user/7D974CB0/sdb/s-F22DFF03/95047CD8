They have shared* *purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month.*\n*The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city_type,* *stay_in_current_city), product details (product_id and product category) and Total purchase_amount from* *last month.*\n*Now, they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against various products* *which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against different products.*\n\nIn summary, we want to see if we can build a model which will predict amount spent by customers (Purchase Amount) on various products using their purchase history. To achieve this aim, we will follow the standard Datascience lifecyle (see figure 1)\n\n![figure 1](images/crispdm.png)\n\n## Data Understanding\n\n**Data**\n```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nVariable <- c(\"User_ID\", \"Product_ID\", \"Gender\", \"Age\", \"Occupation\", \"City_Category\", \"Stay_In_Current_City_Years\", \"Marital_Status\", \"Product_Category_1\", \"Product_Category_2\", \"Product_Category_3\", \"Purchase\")\n\nDefinition <- c(\"User ID\", \"Product ID\", \"Sex of User\", \"Age in bins\", \"Occupation (Masked\", \"Category of the City (A,B,C)\", \"Number of Years stay in current city\", \"Marital Status\", \"Product Category (Masked)\", \"Product may belong to other category also (Masked)\", \"Product may belong to other category also (Masked)\", \"Purchase Amount (Target Variable)\")\n\na <- data.frame(Variable, Definition)\nknitr::kable(a, caption = \"Variables in dataset\")\n```\nTwo datasets were provided for the hack - the training and test datasets with 12 and 11 variables respectively. The \"Purchase Amount\" is the target variable and is hence missing from the test data. \n\n\n\n```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n```\n\n\n```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}\ntrain <- read.csv(\"data/train.csv\", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\ntest <- read.csv(\"data/test.csv\", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n```\n\n**Data structure:**\n\n```{r}\nstr(train)\n\nstr(test)\n```\nThe training and test datasets are read into R and stored as train (550068 rows) and test (233599 rows) \n\n\n\n**Summary statistics:**\n\n```{r}\nsummary(train)\n```\n\n**Define Hypotheses**\n",
