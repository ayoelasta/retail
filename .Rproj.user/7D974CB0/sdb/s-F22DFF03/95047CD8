They have shared* *purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month.*\n*The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city_type,* *stay_in_current_city), product details (product_id and product category) and Total purchase_amount from* *last month.*\n*Now, they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against various products* *which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against different products.*\n\nIn summary, we want to see if we can build a model which will predict amount spent by customers (Purchase Amount) on various products using their purchase history. To achieve this aim, we will follow the standard Datascience lifecyle (see figure 1)\n\n![figure 1](images/crispdm.png)\n\n## Data Understanding\n\n**Data**\n```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nVariable <- c(\"User_ID\", \"Product_ID\", \"Gender\", \"Age\", \"Occupation\", \"City_Category\", \"Stay_In_Current_City_Years\", \"Marital_Status\", \"Product_Category_1\", \"Product_Category_2\", \"Product_Category_3\", \"Purchase\")\n\nDefinition <- c(\"User ID\", \"Product ID\", \"Sex of User\", \"Age in bins\", \"Occupation (Masked\", \"Category of the City (A,B,C)\", \"Number of Years stay in current city\", \"Marital Status\", \"Product Category (Masked)\", \"Product may belong to other category also (Masked)\", \"Product may belong to other category also (Masked)\", \"Purchase Amount (Target Variable)\")\n\na <- data.frame(Variable, Definition)\nknitr::kable(a, caption = \"Variables in dataset\")\n```\n\n\nTwo datasets were provided for the hack - the training and test datasets with 12 and 11 variables respectively. The \"Purchase Amount\" is the target variable and is hence missing from the test data. \n\n\n\n```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(magrittr)\n\n```\n\n\n```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}\ntrain <- read.csv(\"data/train.csv\", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\ntest <- read.csv(\"data/test.csv\", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n```\n\n**Data structure:**\n\n```{r}\nstr(train)\n\nstr(test)\n```\nThe training and test datasets are read into R and stored as train (550068 rows) and test (233599 rows). The summary statistics below show that for the training data, asides from Product Category 2 and Product Category 3, none of the variables have any missing values. The missing product categories is not unexpected as the data dictionary has explained that a product may belong to more than one category. Since Product category 1 has no NA, we may safely assume that the product belongs to category 1 if both categories 2 and 3 are NAs.\n\n\n## Data Preparation\n\nThe Product_ID and USer_ID are interesting features. In many cases, these are usually discarded but in this case, I will keep them till I am sure they are not needed. They have been read in as characters and will be trandformed to factors. The Gender, City_category, Marital_Status, Product Categories and Occupation will also be transformed to factors.\n\nIn addition, the \n\n```{r}\ntrain$User_ID <- as.factor(train$User_ID)\ntest$User_ID <- as.factor(test$User_ID)\n\ntrain$Product_ID <- as.factor(train$Product_ID)\ntest$Product_ID <- as.factor(test$Product_ID)\n\ntrain$Gender <- as.factor(train$Gender)\ntest$Gender <- as.factor(test$Gender)\n\ntrain$City_Category <- as.factor(train$City_Category)\ntest$City_Category <- as.factor(test$City_Category)\n\ntrain$Marital_Status <- as.factor(train$Marital_Status)\ntest$Marital_Status <- as.factor(test$Marital_Status)\n\ntrain$Occupation <- as.factor(train$Occupation)\ntest$Occupation <- as.factor(test$Occupation)\n\ntrain$Product_Category_1 <- as.factor(train$Product_Category_1)\ntest$Product_Category_1 <- as.factor(test$Product_Category_1)\n\ntrain$Product_Category_2 <- as.factor(train$Product_Category_2)\ntest$Product_Category_2 <- as.factor(test$Product_Category_2)\n\ntrain$Product_Category_3 <- as.factor(train$Product_Category_3)\ntest$Product_Category_3 <- as.factor(test$Product_Category_3)\n```\n**Summary statistics:**\n\n```{r}\nsummary(train)\n```\n\n```{r}\nsummary(test)\n```\n**Define Hypotheses**\n\n1. **Product:** The lower the cost of a product, the higher the number of purchases (count).\n\n2. **Gender:** Women spend more on purchases than men\n\n3. **Occupation:** Certain types of occupations (likely dependent on salary band) will have higher purchases\n\n4. **Age:** The older you are, the less you purchase (count and amount spent)\n\n5. **Stay in current city:** The longer you stay in the city, the more purchases you make\n\n6. **Product Category:** The category a product belongs to determines which Gender will have higher purchase (count)\n\n7. **Product Category:** The category a product belongs to determines which Age band will have higher purchase (count)\n\n### Exploratory Data Analysis\nBefore exploring further, I combined both the train and datasets in order to have a broader view of the dataset. However, I created a new variable \"Source\" which acts as label for the two sets and added a variable Purchase for the test set to allow for rbinding. NAs are assigned to this new variable in the test data.\n\n```{r}\ntrain$source <- \"train\"\ntest$source <- \"test\"\ntest$Purchase <- NA\n```\n\n```{r}\ndf <- rbind(train, test)\n```\n\n```{r}\n\nsummary(df)\n\n```\n\n```{r}\ndf %>% count(User_ID) %>%\n  arrange(desc(n)) %>%\n  head(10) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(User_ID, n)) + geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")\n\n```\n\n\nThe plot above shows the top 10 users in terms of counts for the dataset. User 1001680 has the highest number of purchases (1468).\n\n**** Continue from here ****",
